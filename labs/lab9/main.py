Lab 9: Lists

Learning Objectives:

 - Practice using lists and and list indexing,
 - Practice using loops,
 - Practice writing functions.


Background

In recent years, AI advances have allowed computers to perform functions that used to be the exclusive domain of 
human beings.  One of these fields is for computers to understand natural languages.

Understanding may be a bit of an overstatement, as you will see, the AI system is simply providing us a
function where the input is a sentence, and it returns the sentence's sentiment as a number.

Your job is to use this AI to analyze live newsfeeds from reddit, a popular news forum.

I have provided you with the following 2 functions:

    get_sentiment(sentence) - given a sentence (string), it returns a number indiciating the sentiment (or emotion) of the 
    sentence.  Note the following interaction:

    > get_sentiment('this is going to be a great day!')
    0.6588
    > get_sentiment('i hate rainy mornings!')
    -0.6476

    The number returned is of float type and in the range of [-1.0, 1.0].  The higher the number, the more positive the sentence,
    and vice-versa/

    get_reddit_news() - retrieves a list of news titles from reddit's 'worldnews' forum.  
    

You will need to use these functions to complete the exercises.  Pretty much all exercises require you to loop over a list 
of itmes using a for loop and process each item in the list.

The get_sentiment() function returns a number between -1 and 1 for a given string (sentence).

Exercise 1:

Exercise 2:

Given a list of sentences as input, return the maximum (most positive) score

Exercise 3:

Given a list of sentences as input, return the minimum (most negative) score
